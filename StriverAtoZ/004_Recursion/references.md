# Definitions

**recursion**
when a fn calls itself
until a specified condition is met

---

**base condition**
the condition that specifies when the fn should stop calling itself

---

**return statement** 
the fn execution terminates then and there

---

**recursion tree**
graphical representation of the recursive calls made by a fn

---

**parameterized and functional recursion**
parametrized recursion uses extra parameters to track intermediate results durin' the recursive calls, while functional recursion relies on the return values of the recursive calls to build up the final result 

---

**space complexity**

`space complexity = auxiliary space + input space`

auxiliary space refers to the extra space or the temporary space that an algorithm uses. 

space complexity is the total space taken up by the algorithm with respect to the input size.

---

**multiple recursion calls**
when a recursive fn calls itself more than once within its definition.
